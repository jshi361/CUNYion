#CUNYion

##What is CUNYion?
Student Forum where students will be put into private group forum of the class(s) they are taking to help each other out with class related materials. It is only for students and cannot be monitored by professors of respective class due to privacy reasons. 

##Inspiration
Students have been struggling with understanding their materials from classes due to in-clarity or difficult questions given by their professors and ended up failing the class(s) or didn't get the grade they desire. So this web forum will provide the basic guidance in order to pass the class. However, getting the grade students desire will entirely dependent on students themselves.

##What it can do.
Students can post questions or ask for opinions about the topic they would like to discuss and get response(s) from fellow students. Students can post comments if there should be questions that they can answer.
